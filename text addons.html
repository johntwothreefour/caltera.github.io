									<h2>Continents of Caltera</h2>
									<p>The never-ending snows of the North occupies the continent of <strong>Vrigel</strong> [ˈfrigəl]. Predominantly occupied by Vormers, Vrigel is heavily secluded, mostly surrounded by snow capped mountain ranges and deep, dark undiscovered caverns. The entirety of Vrigel is ruled by a single emperor. Although disconnected and often quiet, the numerous cities here have endured years of peaceful economic stability. </p>
									<p>In the west, <strong>Ielyn</strong> [ˈielɪn] consists of miles of open fields and pastures, seldom interrupted by small hills and rivers of varying sizes. Ielyn is mostly composed of small towns and villages, including a great mountain range running down near the western coast. Settlements are under the guidance of their own respective Elders. This continent boasts borders that are heavily guarded by the respective locals inhabiting it, making the process of entering and leaving the continent itself, not so simple for travelers and merchants alike .</p>
									<p>In the east of Caltera lies <strong>Markha</strong> [ˈmɑrkʌ], a continent divided by two conflicting sides: the norther half of Marha and the southern half, Makea. The entire continent is also geographically split down the middle by the Orreal mountain range, with dry deserts in the west, and grasslands to the east. Settlements across Markha are lead by a Chief/Chieftess.</p>
									<p>At the center of Caltera is the continent of <strong>Avalia</strong> [‘əvəlyə]. A land separated by three kingdoms, with one main governing capital nation. The lands are sprawled with grasslands and forests of varying sizes. Avalia harbors the densest populations in Caltera. Two of the nations are represented by a monarchy, while one follows a religious hierarchy. Although power is divided by region, Avalia has been uneventfully at peace for the past century.</p>
									<p><strong>Ogenus</strong> [oʊ’dʒinəs], found in the south, is an archipelago. The largest area of the continent is the landmass attached to the mainland, an area swallowed by deep rain forests and jungles. Most of the inhabitants live on the islands across the Kaya Sea. It is a believed myth that the oldest existing records of Caltera can be found in Ogenus. The continent is relatively upheld and governed by pirate groups, with the rumored “Three Lords of the Deep” at its helm.</p>

									<h2>Religion in Caltera </h2>
									<h3>(The Seven Divines)</h3>
									<p>The divines were benevolent beings that are believed to once have walked among the people of Caltera. In present time, it is said that spiritual guidance is bestowed to those who devote themselves to the Divines. Some ancestries’ cultures, by default, exhibit loyalty towards certain divines. Many people treat the seven as Deities, resulting to religious practice being a common custom throughout the land. 
										Since each divine represent a different facet in the land of Caltera, there is no significant presence of conflict between the different religions and its followers. The divines, along with their respective disciplines are as follows:
